### Kunming-Montreal Goals and target
#### **Goal A:** 
<p class="text-medium">
  (1) The integrity, connectivity and resilience of **all ecosystems** are maintained, enhanced, or restored, substantially increasing the area of natural ecosystems by 2050.
  
  (2) <span class="text-transparent">
  Human induced extinction of known threatened species is halted, and, by 2050, the extinction rate and risk of all species are reduced tenfold and the abundance of native wild species is increased to healthy and resilient levels.
  </span>

  (3) <span class="text-transparent">
  The genetic diversity within populations of wild and domesticated species, is maintained, safeguarding their adaptive potential.
  </span>

</p>

### Kunming-Montreal Goal and target
#### **Target 3:**
::: {.centered .center-box}
  <p class="text-medium">
    Ensure and enable that by 2030 at least 30 per cent of **terrestrial and inland water areas**, and of marine and coastal areas, <span class="text-transparent">especially areas of particular importance for biodiversity and ecosystem functions and services</span>, are effectively conserved and managed through **ecologically representative**, <span class="text-transparent"> well-connected and equitably governed</span> **systems of protected areas and other effective area-based conservation measures**, <span class="text-transparent">recognizing indigenous and traditional territories, where applicable, and integrated into wider landscapes, seascapes and the ocean, while ensuring that any sustainable use, where appropriate in such areas, is fully consistent with conservation outcomes, recognizing and respecting the rights of indigenous peoples and local communities, including over their traditional territories.</span>

### Protected Habitat Evenness Index (PHEI)
::: {.centered .center-box}
  **The PHEI reports the evenness of the spatial distribution of protected areas across ecologically distinct regions and directly adresses Canada's commitment to protect a representative 30% of our landscape.**

### Type of protected areas
*Protected area*: <p class="text-small">‘A clearly defined geographical space, recognized, dedicated and managed, through legal or other effective means, to achieve the long-term conservation of nature with associated ecosystem services and cultural values.’ (Dudley et al., 2008).</p>

*Other effective area-based conservation measure*: <p class="text-small">‘a geographically defined area other than a Protected Area, which is governed and managed in ways that achieve positive and sustained long-term outcomes for the in situ conservation of biodiversity, with associated ecosystem functions and services and where applicable, cultural, spiritual, socio–economic, and other locally relevant values.’ (CBD, 2018).</p>

### Scale
National: Evenness across Canada ecozone given that each one are characterize by varying landscape and biodiveristy.

Subnational: Bioclimatic domains of Qc. Province

## The data

![](figures/map.png)

![](figures/quebec_map.png)

## Method

To calculate the PHE, we take the *inverse* of the Gini inequality index, which is a measure of the extent to which a quantity of interest (traditionally income per countries) is equal across geographical zone.

Here, our quantity of interest are the size of protected areas and the geographical units are ecozones or bioclimatic domains. However, the geographical zone can be any ecologically and jurisdictionally interesting type, like ecoregion, or province.

We have also adapted the index so it accepts *proportions* of protected areas within geographical zones, since our ecozones are of different size. This ensures that one unit increase in proportion in one region has the same weight as a unit increase in another. This works toward our goal of mapping an even distribution of protected areas across ecozones.

The Protected Habitat Evenness Index is calculated as:


$$
PHEI = 1 - G
$$


$$
G = 1 - \frac{2 \sum_{i=1}^{n} i \cdot p_i}{n \sum_{i=1}^{n} p_i} - \frac{n + 1}{n}
$$

Where
*n* is the number of ecozones, and 
$p_{i}$ is the proportion of protected area within the *i* ecozone's total area 


**Interpretation:** Here, we take the inverse of the Gini index, so that 0 maps to low evenness and 1 is a perfect evenness.


# Example of PHE Index over time
![](figures/trend_example.png)

# Interpretation
The PHE index describes how close Canada is to meeting the ecological representativenness of our protected habitats. It highlights regions where further habitat protection initiatives will bring us closer to our commitment.

## Example of use:
- NCC is planning to acquire and preserve land. After applying KBA index and other species conservation indices, they have 4 candidate areas across multiple ecoregions. They simulate the evenness index in each candidate scenario, and choose the to protect the area where the PHE Index is highest.

# Strengths and Limitations
*Limitations*: while the index is useful for regional decision-making and immediate conservation action, its *specificity* is uncertain. Ecozones are **proxy** measures of ecologically relevent protected areas. Although ecozones are accepted ecological distinctions, our method does not account for protected areas where ecozones intersect, which may be particularly sensitive to climate change.

*Strengths*: The index is measurable and adapts a peer-reviewed method to assess inequality across units, the Gini index. The quality of the data is verified and updated continuously by federal agencies. It is simple to communicate, and provides immediate feedback to decision-makers.
